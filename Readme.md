You can use this to build a page builder with Shopify theme blocks in the DAWN theme.
Just copy the section and blocks and paste them into your theme.

**Features**

- 5 building blocks to build custom sections (text,heading,button,image,container)
- Desktop and mobile specific styling options
- 3 presets for instant sections (Image with text, multicolumn, hero banner)

**DISCLAIMER**

This is not well testest and i played around with it. I will maybe update this from time to time when more features like flex sections etc. are released. 
But before using this for yourself or even with clients you should make sure everything works for you as expected by tweaking it to your liking.
